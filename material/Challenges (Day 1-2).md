Feel free to try out any, all or none of the exercises below. If you do try some or all, feel free to send your thoughts/results and discuss with Dinesh/Krishnan.

1. Probability of 2 genetic sequences matching

  Let's take two random genetic sequences of size n (for now n=2)
  - What's the chance that there is no nucleotide matching?
  - What's the chance that there is one nucleotide matching?
  - What's the chance that there is two nucleotide matching? and...
  - so on for n>2
 
   What's the average number of matchings? What is the average proportion of matchings?
avg proportion of matchings = (avg number of matchings) / (total no. of nucleotides)

2. [Luria-Delbruck experiment](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0025556499000450)
    - qualtitave reasoning
    - quantitative and/or simulations
    - if you increase the window of time, what happens? what distribution look like and why?
    - what's the relation between the rate of mutation and parameter of the distribution (of mutations in a given amount of time) obtained?

3. What is mean/median/mode for: 
    - a [bimodal distribution] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_distribution)
    - uniform distribution (go back to the dice question)
    - Gaussian distribution (simulate them and find the mean/median/mode?)

Sorry for the lack of detail. We are unable to attach images successfully on the website. So we are resorting to providing (hyper)links to the terms.

4. When not to use "mean"? 

1. Let's say you and Charles Xavier, who claims to read minds :roll_eyes:, sit down face-to-face to resolve his [chutzpah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chutzpah) once and for all. This is how you go about doing it:
    - you have a deck of cards in front of you and so does Charles
    - you pick out a card, look at the card and place it face down just beside the deck
    - Charles reads your mind :roll_eyes: and picks out the same card from his deck and places just beside it
    - Say you do this with Charles 10 times

  What will be your criterion to judge his claims? (95% confidence) In other words, do you trust he's a psychic? How many correct guesses should he get before you trust him?
