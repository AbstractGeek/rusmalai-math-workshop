## Day 1 (15 February 2018)
	- The premise of probability
    - Writing numbers for words for simple problems: coins, dice, cards
	- Conditionality, Dependence and Independence of events
    - Understanding some examples from biology



## Probability

For now let's stick to the intuitive definition of probability, i.e. what is the chance of an event occurring?

Let's discuss a bit - how would we go about defining this term? Take some examples from lab, without quantifying...

## Statistics

There are many situations where we have to make a decision under uncertainty. How do we decide then?

A general template provided for the "most correct" answer is provided by Statistics:

 1. fix a small number as your "allowed" probability of error (what do we mean by this?) and then
 2. deduce some threshold based on it

When is this hard to do? When is it easy?

What remains is to be able to calculate the probabilities.


## Probability: Quantifying randomness/uncertainty:
## Or how 'random' is random?

 - ### Coin toss

 - ### Die

 - ### An example from biology

### What do these numbers mean?

Coin toss summary:

If all outcomes are equally likely (no biases). Then,

Probability of 'Heads' turning up = 1/2

Probability of 'Tails' turning up = 1/2

If biased?


```python
from random import randint
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
num = 10000
flips = [randint(0,1) for r in range(num)]
# flips = [np.random.binomial(1,0.1) for r in range(num)]
n_Tails = sum(flips)
n_Heads = num - n_Tails
events = ('Heads', 'Tails')
e_pos = np.arange(len(events))
outcome = [n_Heads, n_Tails]
plt.bar(e_pos, outcome, align='center', alpha=0.8)
plt.xticks(e_pos, events)
plt.ylabel('Outcome')
plt.title('Outcome of %d coin tosses' %num)
print("#Heads =", n_Heads)
print("#Tails =", n_Tails)
plt.show()
```

    #Heads = 5005
    #Tails = 4995

Playing a die summary:

If all outcomes are equally likely (no biases). Then,

Probability of '1' turning up = 1/6

Probability of '2' turning up = 1/6

Probability of '3' turning up = 1/6

Probability of '4' turning up = 1/6

Probability of '5' turning up = 1/6

Probability of '6' turning up = 1/6

Again, if biased?

Can we make this look like a coin toss?

An example from biology:

If I were to pick one nucleotide from any organism's genes at random, what would it be? (incomplete question? let's refine it and try to answer!)


Probability of picking out an 'Adenine' (or 'A') = 1/4

Probability of picking out an 'Guanine' (or 'G') = 1/4

Probability of picking out an 'Thymine' (or 'T') = 1/4

Probability of picking out an 'Cytosine' (or 'C') = 1/4


And how would you check that? Count them!

Hold on. Are we making some mistakes/implicit assumptions? Are they reasonable?

What if we were not to pick an organism at random but choose specifically yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*)?

Of course, we would then be much mistaken in our assignment of probabilities.

In yeast,

Probability of picking out an 'Adenine' (or 'A') = 31/100

Probability of picking out an 'Guanine' (or 'G') = 19/100

Probability of picking out an 'Thymine' (or 'T') = 31/100

Probability of picking out an 'Cytosine' (or 'C') = 19/100



Is there a reason that probability of 'G' is equal to that of 'C'?


## Conditionality, Dependence and Independence

Questions we could ask:

- If I picked 'A', what is the chance that of 'T' on the other strand at the same position?
- If I picked 'A', what is the chance that of 'T' on the same strand at an adjacent position?

Let's discuss more examples...

## Discrete and Continuous

So far what is on these slides has been discrete variables. What about probability of continuous variables?

Define chances for a good player, a bad player, a drunk bad player?

Probability of dart in a region = Area of the region / Total area


## Notations and why do we use them?

### The two notions of probability

It so happens that the best way we have so far is to turn to models in probability and apply them.

The two ways in which we understand probability:

1. Classical sense - chance of occurrence over multiple (infinite) repetitions.
This is the way we usually choose and will be using for the major part of this workshop

2. Bayesian sense - a reasonable expectation given our knowledge

### A little bit of formaility

This section is purely for the purposes of agreeing on a common language so that we can deal with the later, more interesting sections. Also, it is in hopes to help you get back to these slides or any other text on Probability and Statistics in future.

We will take some toy examples and try to work out the probabilities of events. But first, ground rules:

1. We will keep in mind what all events could occur. Let's put all of these in one box and call it  $$ \Omega $$

2. Out of all these events we shall denote probability of a particular event E as P(E) (read P of E). This P(E) is a positive real number less than one.

$$ 0 \leq P(E) \leq 1 $$


In case of continuous variables we prefer to define probability densities:

 -  $$ p(x)dx = P(x<E<x+dx) $$  and

 -  $$ \int p(x) dx = 1 $$


Too abstract? Hold on... let's revisit some of our previous examples:

## Revisiting our examples

### Coin toss

Let's say we toss a coin once. All that can happen is - it will land with Head facing up or Tails. Let's put these possible events in a box/set $\Omega = \{H,T\}$.

Now we need to assign numbers to these events, i.e. deduce/decide what their probabilities. Considering the coin is fair, we could say P(H) = P(T) = 0.5. In other words, both outcomes are equally likely...so 50-50 chance for both.

What if we do the same with a die?

You know P('1') = P('2') = P('3') = P('4') = P('5') = P('6') = 1/6.

How would we check if our asignment of probabilities is correct? Well, we would take the coin and toss it multiple times, say a 100 times and see how many times Head or Tail turn up. So we would expect close to 50 times (heads or tails). This is intricately related to the Classical notion of probability - that over multiple realizations the proportion of times the event E happens is its probability, i.e

$$  P(E) = \frac{\text{no. of times event E happened}}{\text{Total no. of realizations}}  $$

And the same goes for cards!

In some sense, they are all "coin tosses" in which all outcomes are equally likely.

Now, what's a simple "coin toss" example in biology?

If I were to pick one nucleotide from any organism's genes at random, what would it be?
It could be any one from  $$\Omega = \{A,T,G,C\} $$ with probability

P(A) = P(T) = P(G) = P(C) = 0.25

And how would you check that? Count them!

What if we were not to pick an organism at random but choose a specifically yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)? We would then be much mistaken in our assignment of probabilities. In fact, we would something more close to

P(A) = P(T) = 0.31

P(G) = P(C) = 0.19

This is case of a biased 4-sided "coin" or "die".


## Revisiting our examples

### Coin toss

Let's put these possible events in a box/set  $$\Omega = \{H,T\} $$.

P(H) = P(T) = 0.5

This defines our 'Probability Space'!

For a biased coin,  $$\Omega = \{H,T\} $$

P(H) = p

P(T) = 1-p


## Revisiting our examples

### Picking a nucleotide

 $$ Ω=\{A,T,G,C\} $$

P(A) = P(T) = P(G) = P(C) = 0.25

For yeast,  $$ Ω=\{A,T,G,C\} $$

P(G) = P(C) = p

P(T) = P(A) =  $$ \frac{1-2p}{2} $$

Is this assignment in the case of yeast wrong?

Well, depends on what we are talking about. Generally, while reporting/recording the genetic sequence of an organism, sequence of only of the strands is given (could you tell me whether it's 5'-3' or 3'-5'? I don't know the convention). Hence, if by P(G) we are asking for the probability of 'G' on any of this printed/reported sequence then we are considering only that strand. In this case our assignment of probabilities would be wrong because it could be that one strand has more G than the other but is balanced by the other strand having more C by the same amount. The correct way to assign probabilities would be

|   | Strand 1 | Strand 2 |
| ------- |:-------------:| :-----:|
| A |    r     |    q     |
| T |    q     |    r     |
| G |    y     |    x     |
| C |    x     |    y     |

where
$$ 2r+2q = \text{Total AT content} = 0.62 $$
$$ 2x+2y = \text{Total GC content} = 0.38 $$
and this is the best we can do with the information given (without assuming anything else)

Also, in this case we would ideally want to define  $$\Omega = \{ A_1, A_2, T_1, T_2, G_1, G_2, C_1, C_2\} $$ with subscripts defining the strand number.

However, if by P(G) we were asking about the probability of 'G' in the whole DNA content (any of the two strands), then our original assignment is correct.

## Dependence

If 'A' is picked, what is the probability of 'T' on complementary strand?

$$ P(T|A) = \frac{P(A\cap T)}{P(A)} $$
    where $$ \cap $$ means intersection of the two.

Is this formulation correct? Need to make it precise: what's the sample space  $$ \Omega $$ ?

| | | |
| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
|  $$ \large A_1A_2 $$  |  $$ T_1A_2 $$  |  $$ G_1A_2 $$  |  $$ C_1A_2 $$  |
|  $$ \large A_1T_2 $$  |  $$ \large T_1T_2 $$  |  $$ \large G_1T_2 $$  |  $$ \large C_1T_2 $$  |
|  $$ \large A_1G_2 $$  |  $$ T_1G_2 $$  |  $$ G_1G_2 $$  |  $$ C_1G_2 $$  |
|  $$ \large A_1C_2 $$  |  $$ T_1C_2 $$  |  $$ G_1C_2 $$  |  $$ C_1C_2 $$  |

I have highlighted (emphasized) the ones containing 'A' on the first strand and 'T' on the complementary. The only interection is  $$ A_1T_2 $$  (quite obvious, but I'm trying to write in formal notation). Now, we have defined our  $$ \Omega $$ . What remains it to assign probabilities to the elements of  $$ \Omega $$ . Knowing the complementarity of the strands, we assign 0.25 to each of  $$ A_1T_2 $$ ,  $$ T_1A_2 $$ ,   $$ G_1C_2 $$ ,  $$ C_1G_2 $$  and 0 to everything else.

Now probability of seeing 'T' on the complementary strand given that 'A' was found on the first strand is given by
 $$ P(T_2|A_1) = \frac{P(A_1\cap T_2)}{P(A_1)} = \frac{0.25}{P(A_1)} $$

Note that  $$ P(A_1) = P(A_1A_2)+P(A_1T_2)+P(A_1G_2)+P(A_1C_2) = 0.25 $$
$$ \therefore \: P(T_2|A_1) = 1 $$ meaning we are sure to find T on the complementary strand given we saw A on the first
