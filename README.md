# RUSMALAI math workshop
One of the major aims of this workshop is to build intuition and vocabulary which is commonly used in data analysis in most fields of biology. Another is to keep it very informal so that there is no barrier in attending the workshop. In fact, we plan to start it from scratch so that anyone can join in without hesitation. Because the basics topics covered here are identical to the ones used in machine learning, the workshop will be done under the aegis of RUSMALAI.

Although there will be only one session per week, we would be happy to discuss throughout the week (preferably post-work hours). We plan to give optional things to think about and would be glad to have a discussion on these or any other thing related to the topics going on. For such chit-chat/discussions please do walk in to the Simons Center on the ground floor or Sane lab.

The idea is to start with basic concepts like probability and linear algebra, and build slowly to more advanced topics like Bayesian inference, Markov processes, PCA, etc. Below is the plan for the workshop (will be updated incrementally).

## Probability and Statistics

Outline/breakdown for the module on Probability & Statistics:

* Day 1: Revisiting the basics
	* The premise of probability
    * Writing numbers for words for simple problems: coins, dice, cards
	* Conditionality, Dependence and Independence of events
    * Understanding some examples from biology

* Day 2: Distribution functions and how they come about + Stats
	* Examples of discrete variables (probability mass function)
	* Examples of continuous variables (probability distribution functions)
	* Benefits and caveats of using Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs)
	* The basic idea of Statistical tests

* Day 3: Bayesian approach to probability
	* Bayesian method with examples
	* posterior/prior distribution with examples
	* Examples and implementation of Bayesian methods
	* Bootstrap methods and highlight some problems

* Day 4: Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Maximum Aposteriori Probability and practical uses of them


## Linear Algebra
