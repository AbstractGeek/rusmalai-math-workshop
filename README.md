## Probability and Statistics 

Outline/breakdown for the module on Probability & Statistics:

* Day 1: Revisiting the basics
	* The premise of probability
	* Writing numbers for words for simple problems: coins, dice, cards
	* Conditionality, Dependence and Independence of events
	* Understanding some examples from biology

* Day 2: Distribution functions and how they come about + Stats
	* Examples of discrete variables (proabibility mass function) 
	* Examples of continuous variables (probability distribution functions)
	* Benefits and caveats of using Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs)
	* The basic idea of Statistical tests

* Day 3: Bayesian approach to probability
	* Bayesian method with examples
	* posterior/prior distribution with examples
	* Examples and implementation of Bayesian methods
	* Bootstrap methods and highlight some problems

* Day 4: Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Maximum Aposteriori Probability and practical uses of them
